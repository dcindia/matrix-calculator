title: Matrix Calculator
excerpt: "Python based software for Desktop & Android to calculate  Determinant of provided Matrix."
---

## Introduction
Do you remember your *Higher Secondary* **Mathematics** book. 💀  
No problem. There is a concept of **Determinants** that are special calculations based on a *Matrix*.
These calculations are very hard and prone to *Silly Mistakes*.  
Here, I created this program to directly give *Desired Answer*. Life is much Better now.😉

## Troubleshooting
As python is not officialy supported by Android, there can be devices where it not works. If you encounter such issues, please report in [**Issues**](https://github.com/dcindia/matrix-calculator/issues) Section.  
If the problem occurs in Windows or Linux, check if the libraries are properly installed. Kivy and KivyMD were in development stage at the time of writing the program. It may happen that internal code changed, so you have to uninstall previously installed libraries and again install it according to my Guide.  
For Any problem, feel free to raise an issue.

**_Any Improvements or Added Features are heartly welcomed._**
